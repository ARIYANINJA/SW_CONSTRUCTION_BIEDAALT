It has survived not only five centuries, but also the&#10; leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was&#10; popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing&#10; Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software&#10; like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.&#10;Why do we use it?&#10;It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable&#10; content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem &#10;Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed&#10; to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.&#10; Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem &#10;" textFill="#2dff04">
